Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

                    `url` gives the location of the app, in standard URL form (`[scheme://]host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified.

                    The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address.

                    A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the app, for example, a cluster identifier.

                    Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either.

              description: "RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.\n\nTo
                use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your
                external, versioned struct, and Object in your internal struct. You
                also need to register your various plugin types.\n\n// Internal package:
                type MyAPIObject struct {\n\truntime.TypeMeta `json:\",inline\"`\n\tMyPlugin
                runtime.Object `json:\"myPlugin\"`\n} type PluginA struct {\n\tAOption
                string `json:\"aOption\"`\n}\n\n// External package: type MyAPIObject
                struct {\n\truntime.TypeMeta `json:\",inline\"`\n\tMyPlugin runtime.RawExtension
                `json:\"myPlugin\"`\n} type PluginA struct {\n\tAOption string `json:\"aOption\"`\n}\n\n//
                On the wire, the JSON will look something like this: {\n\t\"kind\":\"MyAPIObject\",\n\t\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\n\t\"myPlugin\":
                {\n\t\t\"kind\":\"PluginA\",\n\t\t\"aOption\":\"foo\",\n\t},\n}\n\nSo
                what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized
                data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be
                stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion)
                into the internal struct. The runtime package's DefaultScheme has
                conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in
                RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing
                it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown
                type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)"
